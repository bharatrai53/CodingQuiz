# CodingQuiz

## Description
The Coding Quiz project was created so that I could utilize my skills learned in JavaScript to date including creating functions, event listeners, and local storage. The quiz is timed (starting at 30 seconds decrements every second) and will test new students with some questions pulled from previous lessons that we have learned throughout the bootcamp to date. When students select a correct answer their time will increase by 10 seconds and if they answer incorrectly their time will decrement by 10 seconds. By the end of the quiz, a student will receive a highscore where they will get prompted to save their intials in order to save their score in local storage. 

## Usage
Start the quiz by pressing the 'start' button at the beginning of the landing page. Once you have started answer as many questions as you can in the allotted time to beat your high score. To view your previous scores click the 'View Highscores' tab at the top right of the page to see your scores list. When the quiz ends, ensure that you enter your initals as a prompt will let you know to do so if you forget to.
